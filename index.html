          We focus and depend primarily on the low level milk producing farmers
          tocomplete our orders that we receive from our customers . we make
          sure that the farmers get their fair share of profit and benefits from
          doing business with our company if they are enrolled in our
          subscription service

            First and foremost priority Our first branch in our distribution
            tree focuses on completing bulk orders from milk processing
            facilitieswhich require large volume of milk for their daily
            purposes. our aim in the first distribution branch is to fulfill the
            requirements of milk processing plants before any other oorders as
            this pathway results in quick profit and minimal wastage.

            Waste mitigation once the first priority is fulfilled , we focus on
            businesses that require milk for their product maufacturing process.
            The main objective of this channel is helping us in reducing our
            wastages and improving our profits as these businesses usually
            require small volume of milk . the leftover milk in the inventory at
            the end of the day can be sold to these businesses for quick profit
            and low level of loss due to unsold inventory

            channels , we finally turn our attention to our vision and providing
            a better tomorrow for the society . we sell our procurements to non
            profit organisation and health centres at a discounted price . we
            sell our procurements at discounted price to NGOs and we retain this
            loss by embedding the NGOs to our subscription service.
